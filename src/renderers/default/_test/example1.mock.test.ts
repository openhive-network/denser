In our [engineering update released earlier today](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/engineering-update-all-team-meeting-condenser-split) we announced that we would soft roll-out the new Wallet app. Well, we are now happy to announce the soft roll-out of the new Wallet application! To see what we mean, head on over to [steemitwallet.com](https://steemitwallet.com). For the time being, a full version of Condenser will be running on steemit.com, but once the Wallet app has been sufficiently tested, the new Social app will be rolled out to steemit.com. At that time, users who attempt to access their Steem wallet will be redirected to [steemitwallet.com](https://steemitwallet.com), so it was very important to maintain a consistent user experience. At that point, the Condenser Split will be complete.

<h1>Check It Out</h1>

The reason we are following this soft rollout strategy is so that users can begin familiarizing themselves with this new application, so be sure to head on over to [steemitwallet.com](https://steemitwallet.com) to see what the experience is like. One change you will see on steemit.com is that when you try to sign in with your Active or Owner Key, you will now receive the following warning:

The goal is to make the User Experience between the two applications as seamless as possible, so if you notice anything disruptive in this experience, please leave us feedback in the comments section below. 

<h1>The Mission</h1>

Our Mission at Steemit is to help build great online communities with financial inclusion. To that end, we envision a vibrant communities web application that features cryptocurrency incentives, the development of which is economically sustainable and scalable. Splitting Condenser into separate Social and Wallet applications will constitute a major step toward accomplishing our mission by enabling us to improve each application faster, consume fewer resources, and generate more revenue, while maximizing user security by enhancing the client-side signing experience.
