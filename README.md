## Getting Started

First, run the development server: ‚ö°Ô∏è

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing
### E2E Playwright
You can run automatic e2e tests in localhost by using node scripts but first run local Denser App by `npm run dev`
- `npm run pw:test:local:chromium` (to run tests on the Chrome browser engine)
- `npm run pw:test:local:firefox` (to run tests on the Firefox browser engine)
- `npm run pw:test:local:webkit` (to run tests on the Safari browser engine)
- `npm run pw:test:local` (to run tests on the browser engines above)
